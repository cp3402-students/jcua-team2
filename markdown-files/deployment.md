# Development and Deployment Workflow

Our development and deployment process is designed to make sure updates are easy to manage, test, and deploy. Here's a simple guide to how it works:

## 1. Version Control (Git)  
We use Git for version control to keep track of all changes. Each team member works in their own branch, and once changes are ready, they are merged into the main branch. This helps prevent any conflicts or issues. We commit our changes regularly to keep everything updated.

## 2. Local Development  
Before working on updates, each team member pulls the latest version of the code from the repository to make sure they are working with the most recent changes. Updates are made locally and tested before being committed and pushed to the main branch.

## 3. Testing  
After changes are made locally, they are tested on a staging site. The staging site mirrors the live site, allowing us to test all features and functionality before making updates to the live site. We also run automated tests to ensure everything works as expected and no features are broken.

## 4. Deployment  
Once everything is tested and ready, we deploy the updates to the live site. Before doing this, we make sure to back up the live site to avoid any data loss. Changes are pushed to the staging site first, and once everything looks good, they are deployed to the live site.

## 5. Project Management  
We use tools like Trello and Slack to help with project management. These tools allow us to assign tasks, track progress, and stay in communication with the team. They help us stay organized and ensure that everyone knows what they need to do.

## 6. Documentation  
Throughout the process, we document all our work, including how we make updates, test them, and deploy them. This helps new team members or future developers understand how everything works and how to continue development or make changes.

# Documentation in Other Files

We keep all important documentation in separate Markdown files to ensure everything is clearly recorded and easily accessible. Here’s a breakdown of how we organize our documentation:

## 1. README.md  
This file provides a basic overview of the project, including its purpose, key features, and any setup instructions. It also includes links to other documentation files for more detailed information on the development and deployment processes.

## 2. deployment.md  
This file contains the detailed development and deployment workflow, explaining how to make updates locally, test them, and deploy them to staging and live environments. It outlines the process step-by-step, ensuring that anyone taking over the project can follow the steps to maintain and update the site.

## 3. theme.md  
The theme.md file is dedicated to providing detailed information about the custom theme we’ve developed. It includes explanations of key design decisions, how to edit different parts of the theme, and the features available. This file is especially helpful for new developers who need to continue developing the theme or make changes in the future.

## 4. site.md  
This file explains how to manage and update content on the live site. It includes instructions for adding new pages or posts, organizing content into categories, and using any specific plugins or features we’ve integrated into the site. This file is mainly aimed at the client or site administrator, providing them with the necessary information to manage the site effectively without needing technical expertise.

By following this process and maintaining clear documentation, we ensure that updates are managed smoothly, tested thoroughly, and safely deployed to both the staging and live sites.
