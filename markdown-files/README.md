# CP3402-Team-B

## Overview:

For this assignment, our team has been tasked with designing and developing a website for Baizonn Learning Centre. The project involves carrying out all the essential steps of the design process, including information architecture, interface design, and information design. While we have creative freedom over most design decisions, we will ensure all client-specified requirements are met. Our design will be tailored to align with Baizonn’s goals and target audience. Starting from a blank canvas, we will create a custom theme from scratch and use it as the foundation for building out the site’s content. To support this process, we have established our own development workflow to ensure an efficient and organized approach throughout the project.

## Objectives:

- Develop a fully functional website for Baizonn Learning Centre based on their requirements.
- Create a custom theme from scratch, starting from a blank canvas.
- Design the site to be visually appealing, user-friendly, and aligned with Baizonn’s goals and target audience.
- Ensure the website is easy to use and responsive.
- Design a theme that can be easily edited in the future, given the right instructions.
- Include plugins that enhance the site's functionality and make it more dynamic.
- Use Markdown (.md) files to document the web design process for future developers using the theme.
- Find a reliable site provider that can host our WordPress domain for the time being.
- Incorporate client-specified requirements into the final product.
- Establish and follow a structured development workflow to manage the project efficiently.
- Use applications such as Slack and Trello to coordinate our work, keep everyone on track, and ensure clear task assignments.
- Populate the website with relevant, appropriate, and client-approved content.
- Maintain consistency in design and functionality across all site pages.
- Deliver a professional, polished product that reflects Baizonn’s branding and mission.

## Deliverables:

This project includes a set of key files to support the development, management, and future updates of the Baizonn Learning Centre website. In addition to a zipped version of our custom WordPress theme, we have included a project.html file containing site links and login details. The documentation is designed to assist both developers and site maintainers. The README.md provides a brief overview of the project and links to the other documents. The deployment.md outlines our development and deployment workflow, covering tools like version control, project management, testing, and deployment steps. The theme.md explains the features and structure of our custom theme, offering guidance for future developers. The site also makes use of selected WordPress plugins to add dynamic functionality such as event calendars and contact forms, helping to improve interactivity and user engagement. We have ensured the website is fully responsive, meaning it adapts smoothly across a range of devices and screen sizes to provide an optimal user experience. Lastly, the site.md serves as a guide for the client or site maintainer, detailing how to manage and update content using WordPress, including how to use plugins and organize posts and pages.

## Delegated Tasks:

The project was divided into specific tasks to ensure efficient development and a successful outcome. One team member was responsible for setting up WordPress on the hosting server and securing the site with an SSL certificate. Another focused on creating a custom theme that aligns with Baizonn Learning Centre’s branding. We utilized Git version control throughout the development process to track changes, collaborate effectively, and ensure proper version management. Additionally, all work completed was documented to maintain clear records of our progress and provide future developers with the necessary information to continue development. After completing the development, the team collaborated to launch the site and provided the client with instructions on how to manage content using the WordPress content management system. This structured approach, including version control and documentation, helped maintain an organized workflow and ensured the successful delivery of the project.

## Version Control and Documentation:

Throughout the development of this project, we utilized Git version control to manage and track changes, ensuring smooth collaboration among team members. This allowed us to maintain a clear history of updates and easily resolve any conflicts that arose. In addition to version control, all work completed was thoroughly documented to provide a clear record of the development process and assist future developers in understanding the project. This approach ensured that the project was developed efficiently, with well-managed code and clear documentation for ongoing maintenance and updates.
